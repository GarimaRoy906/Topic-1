        <p><h2><em>Questions for Activity 2: Smart Building
        </em></h2>
            1. What does smart means?<br>
            2. What are the main features of a Smart Building?<br>
            3. What are Smart Building scenarios?<br>
        <h3>What does smart mean?</h3>
        Using traditional systems in conjunction with cutting-edge
        technology to create an efficient and secure product. <br>

        <h3>What are the main features of a Smart Building?</h3>
            1. Security<br>
            2. Quality and Reliability<br>
            3. Energy<br>
            4. Cloud Storage<br>

        <h3>What are Smart Building scenarios?</h3>
            
            1.<em><u> Smart Parking System:</em></u> Having a reserved parking spot saves people time, stress, and money.<br>
            2.<em><u> Emergency Evacuation system</em></u> (like electrical leaks): In case of emergencies like fire, finding safe areas to exit the building.<br>
            3.<em><u> Lighting control</em></u><br>
            4.<em><u> Smart Security System:</em></u> Consisting technologies like face detection for safety purposes <br>
            5.<em><u> Smart speakers</em></u><br>
            6.<em><u> Smart Guest Guidance System:</em></u> To automate the guest check-in process. <br>
            <br>
            
            <p><h2><em>Questions for Activity 3: Control Interface
            </em></h2>
                1. What are the high-level features?<br>
                2. Who are the users?<br>
                3. What are the parts needed?<br>
        <h3>What are the high-level features?</h3>
            1. Appropriate and Adequate<br>
            2. Flexibility<br>
            3. Power Optimization<br>
            4. Security and Privacy<br>
        
        <h3>Who are the users?</h3>
            1. <u><em>Smart Parking System:</em></u> Residents using the parking slot <br><br>
            2. <u><em>Smart Security System</em></u> <br><br>
            3. <u><em>Emergency Evacuation System: </u></em> Residents, Staff and Visitors
        
        <h3>What are the parts needed?</h3>
            1. <em><u>Smart Parking System: </em></u>
            For every parking region, Infra-Red (IR) sensors 
            are located and IR sensors would recognise the 
            number of parking slots, Number of free and
            booked slots are explicitly presented in LCD screen, 
            WIFI module is utilized for communication between
            mobile app and sensors. 
            <br> <br>
            2. <em><u>Smart Security System: </em></u>
            IoT provides smart security by combining AI
            to enhance the performance of devices such 
            as CCTV cameras, smart lights, doorbells, and
            fire sensors.
